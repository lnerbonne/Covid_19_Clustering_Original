# Abstract

This is a attempted partial reproduction study of J. Chakraborty's 2021 study 'Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S.'. 
In it, I'll first copy Chakraborty's workflow extracting the covid incidence rate for different disability demographic groups, assessing the correlation between county-level case incidence and the population of these demographics. 
Then we'll deviate from Chakraborty's work by clustering county-level cases using kulldorf spatial filtering to generate case clusters to get a better idea of the spatial organization of disease spread at this point in the pandemic.

# Study design

This work is a partial **reproduction study** to assess the feasibility of reproduction of geographic research. 
Because the original study is likely unable to be replicated perfectly solely from the avalible manuscript, planned deviations will change the end result of the study. 
I have two goals for this study: 

1)to assess the correlation between disabled populations and covid 19 incidence rate in the initial pandemic surge and
2)assess the clustering of case incidence between counties

A successful study result will be able to reach similar findings to Chakraborty in relation to the correlation between disability and incidence rate, 
as well as create county clusters of high covid incidence using kulldorf filtering. 

The original study is a **observational** study that seeks to answer the question "is Covid 19 incidence higher in counties that have a higher percentage of disabled population?".
This research question is ultimately broke into 5 specific hypothesis, investigating whether people with disabilities are effected differently depending on their race, ethnicity, poverty level, age, and biological sex.

The original study was conducted in ArcGIS and SaTScan software; in this reproduction I'll attempt to match methods using R instead. 

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", sf, )

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2023-06-26"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

### US CENSUS American Community Survey

- `Title`: County Level Poverty and Disability Data, Derived from 2014-2018 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
- `Abstract`: This dataset documents poverty and disability data on the county level. The US Census Bureau collects the data in order to produces information on social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the nation's population every year, which provides an important tool for communities to use and see how they are changing. 
- `Spatial Coverage`: United States, OSM [link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/148838#map=3/36.46/-80.16)
- `Spatial Resolution`: Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
- `Spatial Representation Type`: Specify the model of spatial data representation, e.g. one of `vector`, `grid`, `textTable`, `tin` (triangulated irregular network), etc. If the type is `vector`, also specify the geometry type as in the OGC Simple Feature Access standard (https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sfa/) , e.g. `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `MULTIPOLYGON`, etc. 
- `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
- `Temporal Coverage`: 2014-2018
- `Lineage`: We computed the summary statistics, including the min, max, mean, and standard deviation. We processed the data after retrieving it by excluding states that irrelevant to our study area. We also checked for data duplication and omission: we found one county with missing disability and poverty data, for which we replaced the missing data with zeros.
- `Distribution`: The data is avalible for download from the US Census
- `Constraints`: The US Census Data is open access in the public domain. 
- `Variables`: For each variable, enter the following information. If you have two or more variables per data source, you may want to present this information in table form (shown below)
  - `Label`: variable name as used in the data or code
  - `Alias`: intuitive natural language name
  - `Definition`: Short description or definition of the variable. Include measurement units in description.
  - `Type`: data type, e.g. character string, integer, real
  - `Accuracy`: e.g. uncertainty of measurements
  - `Domain`: Expected range of Maximum and Minimum of numerical data, or codes or categories of nominal data, or reference to a standard codebook
  - `Missing Data Value(s)`: Values used to represent missing data and frequency of missing data observations
  - `Missing Data Frequency`: Frequency of missing data observations: not yet known for data to be collected

- `Spatial Resolution`: Counties
- `Spatial Representation Type`: Vector Polygon
- `Spatial Reference System`: Mercator
- `Temporal Coverage`: 1/22/20-8-1-20

We selected columns that are relevant to our analysis. They are POP_ESTIMA and Confirmed, which we then renamed to pop and cases respectively.
We calculated the COVID rate by dividing cases with the total population. 
Finally, we dropped the geometry of the dataset.

## Prior observations  

At the time of this study pre-registration, the authors had prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the geographic, population, and historical disease spread phenomena to be studied.

For each primary data source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [X] no data collection has started
- [ ] pilot test data has been collected
- [ ] data collection is in progress and data has not been observed
- [ ] data collection is in progress and __% of data has been observed
- [ ] data collection is complete and data has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.

## Bias and threats to validity

Extensive knowledge of the physical and social geography of the United States might mean that some conclusions drawn will be influenced by prior knowlege of movement patterns ect. 
Additionally, lived experience throughout the course of the pandemic may bias interpretation of patterns in the data. 

From a data side, reporting and testing of cases was notoriously inconsistent across municipalities, states, and regions. 
This means that some counties will likely be incorrectly reported, and that inconsistencies are often correlated (a whole state de-emphasizing testing, resulting in low case counting)

## Data transformations

### JHU Covid Cases
To explore the JHU incidence rates, I'll calculate the incidence rate per 100,000 and map it, looking to duplicate Chakraborty's mapped figure. 
  (product)- Map of Covid 19 incidence rate nationwide. 
### ACS

Aquire data from the ACS- specifically acs_vars_S1810 for disability data and acs5_c18130 for poverty data. 
Use Mutate to create a population percentage with disabilities by dividing the number of reported disabilities by total population that there exists a disability deisgnation for.
This specifically is NOT the total population, as the total number of disability vs. no disability answers is less than the total population of counties. 
  (product)- Map of PWD rates nationwide

I will use corr() to determine the correlation between covid cases and pct disability, running for each disability subgroup. 
P values will then be created for each correlation using the following formulas (as per statistics), assigning them to their respective columns with mutate.

t= abs(r)/sqrt((1-r^2)/(df))
p= pt(t, df, lower.tail = FALSE)

This correlation and significance value is the final product for my reproduction of the initial phase of Chakraborty's disability correlation work in this paper. The final table should match the corresponding table in his manuscript.
