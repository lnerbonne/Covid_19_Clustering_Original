# Abstract

This is a attempted partial reproduction study of J. Chakraborty's 2021 study 'Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S.'. 
In it, I'll first copy Chakraborty's workflow extracting the covid incidence rate for different disability demographic groups, assessing the correlation between county-level case incidence and the population of these demographics. 
Then we'll deviate from Chakraborty's work by clustering county-level cases using kulldorf spatial filtering to generate case clusters to get a better idea of the spatial organization of disease spread at this point in the pandemic.

# Study design

This work is a partial **reproduction study** to assess the feasibility of reproduction of geographic research. 
Because the original study is likely unable to be replicated perfectly solely from the avalible manuscript, planned deviations will change the end result of the study. 
I have two goals for this study: 

1)to assess the correlation between disabled populations and covid 19 incidence rate in the initial pandemic surge and
2)assess the clustering of case incidence between counties

A successful study result will be able to reach similar findings to Chakraborty in relation to the correlation between disability and incidence rate, 
as well as create county clusters of high covid incidence using kulldorf filtering. 

The original study is a **observational** study that seeks to answer the question "is Covid 19 incidence higher in counties that have a higher percentage of disabled population?".
This research question is ultimately broke into 5 specific hypothesis, investigating whether people with disabilities are effected differently depending on their race, ethnicity, poverty level, age, and biological sex.

The original study was conducted in ArcGIS and SaTScan software; in this reproduction I'll attempt to match methods using R instead.

## Data and variables

All variables in this study were derived from secondary data.
There are no experimentally manipulated variables in this experiment.
Eighteen independent variables, a percentage of total disabled persons per county and seventeen 'disaggregated' categories that break down socio-demographic characteristics of the disabled population.
COVID-19 incidence rate can be seen as the dependent variables.

### US CENSUS American Community Survey

- `Title`: County Level Poverty and Disability Data, Derived from 2014-2018 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
- `Abstract`: This dataset documents poverty and disability data on the county level. The US Census Bureau collects the data in order to produces information on social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the nation's population every year, which provides an important tool for communities to use and see how they are changing. 
- `Spatial Coverage`: United States, OSM [link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/148838#map=3/36.46/-80.16)
- `Spatial Resolution`: Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
- `Spatial Representation Type`: Specify the model of spatial data representation, e.g. one of `vector`, `grid`, `textTable`, `tin` (triangulated irregular network), etc. If the type is `vector`, also specify the geometry type as in the OGC Simple Feature Access standard (https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sfa/) , e.g. `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `MULTIPOLYGON`, etc. 
- `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
- `Temporal Coverage`: 2014-2018
- `Lineage`: We computed the summary statistics, including the min, max, mean, and standard deviation. We processed the data after retrieving it by excluding states that irrelevant to our study area. We also checked for data duplication and omission: we found one county with missing disability and poverty data, for which we replaced the missing data with zeros.
- `Distribution`: The data is avalible for download from the US Census
- `Constraints`: The US Census Data is open access in the public domain.

## Prior observations  

At the time of this study pre-registration, the authors had prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the geographic, population, and historical disease spread phenomena to be studied.

For each primary data source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [X] no data collection has started
- [ ] pilot test data has been collected
- [ ] data collection is in progress and data has not been observed
- [ ] data collection is in progress and __% of data has been observed
- [ ] data collection is complete and data has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.


## Bias and threats to validity

Extensive knowledge of the physical and social geography of the United States might mean that some conclusions drawn will be influenced by prior knowlege of movement patterns ect. 
Additionally, lived experience throughout the course of the pandemic may bias interpretation of patterns in the data. 

From a data side, reporting and testing of cases was notoriously inconsistent across municipalities, states, and regions. 
This means that some counties will likely be incorrectly reported, and that inconsistencies are often correlated (a whole state de-emphasizing testing, resulting in low case counting)


## Data transformations

### JHU Covid Cases
To explore the JHU incidence rates, I'll calculate the incidence rate per 100,000 and map it, looking to duplicate Chakraborty's mapped figure. 
  (product)- Map of Covid 19 incidence rate nationwide. 


### ACS
Aquire data from the ACS- specifically acs_vars_S1810 for disability data and acs5_c18130 for poverty data. 
Use Mutate to create a population percentage with disabilities by dividing the number of reported disabilities by total population that there exists a disability deisgnation for.
This specifically is NOT the total population, as the total number of disability vs. no disability answers is less than the total population of counties. 
  (product)- Map of PWD rates nationwide


## Analysis


### Statistical Correlation of Disability Rates and Covid Incidence

I will use corr() to determine the correlation between covid cases and pct disability, running for each disability subgroup. 
P values will then be created for each correlation using the following formulas (as per statistics), assigning them to their respective columns with mutate.

t= abs(r)/sqrt((1-r^2)/(df))
p= pt(t, df, lower.tail = FALSE)

This correlation and significance value is the final product for my reproduction of the initial phase of Chakraborty's disability correlation work in this paper. The final table should match the corresponding table in his manuscript.


### Clustering Analysis

For the second section of the methods, I'll attempt to create a map of clusters of counties that have high covid incidence rates. 
This is somewhat of a reproduction of Chakraborty's work in that he used county clusters as an input into generalized estimating equations attempting to account for spatial autocorrelation in his disability analysis. 
To delineate his high-incidence clusters Chakraborty used SATScan, a spatio-temporal statistical software that was developed for the monitoring of diseases. 
While potentially effective in this case, the selection of SATSCAN as the tool to account for spatial correlation is likely a product of Chakraborty's epidemiology background.
To attempt to mimic his results using R, I will use a kulldorff filter in the SpatialEpi R package. 

To generate clusters, Spatial Epi will use relative risk (comparing local incidence to global incidence rates) to determine areas of relatively higher risk. SpatialEpi will then be used to group counties that have a similarly high risk profile.
The package will return the primary clusters and it's best estimation of any secondary clusters, if they exist. 
To assess the effectivness of this method, I will map clusters to determine if they are accuratly modeling the perceived clustering of high risk counties. 

The SpatialEpi output will produce clusters but doesn't automatically assign them a unique identifier; to do this, I'll concatonate the state name with their relative risk score (a RR of 1 in New York will become NY1).
This approach works in this situation because SpatialEpi will group counties within the same state and with the same risk level into one cluster. 

I'll check the result of this concatonation by checking to make sure each cluster is assigned a unique identifier.

From these clusters I'll be able to map the assessed clusters qualatativly. This map should match Chakraborty's clustering data that he inputted to his GEEs. 


# Results

Correlation results between disabled populations and COVID incidence will be reported in a table. High-incidence county clusters will be presented visually in map-form. 


# Discussion

Because this study seeks to both A) Reproduce Chakraborty's work, assessing for validity and B) use our own methodology to recreate clustering done in an external program, analysis will be split into two sections. 
The first will explore the correlation between disability rate at the county scale and incidence - if there is a realtionship between the disability subcategories and covid incidence like Chakraborty found, we should return significant r values.
The second section will compare our finished clusters to Chakraborty's before thinking about why any differences might occur, given that we're using a different program to generate our clusters than he did. I'm not expecting that the clusters will turn out exactly the same, so it'll be interesting to intterogate why any differences arise.
